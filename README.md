# Arduino Controlled Autonomous Robot for Ball Collection
In this project, we do the following things:  
· Employed Pixy Camera and image segmentation algorithm to locate the ball and container in real time  
· Wrote PID algorithm for the robot to track and follow the ball, programmed in Arduino IDE  
· Collaborated on the design and fabrication the robots powertrain, sensor and navigation hardware  

### Two demo ball tracking videos and our performance in final competition
